# Assignment 1: Collocation of words in corpus
This folder contains the scripts for finding collocation in a txt-file given a search-term and a window. All solutions are python scripts with cmd-arguments. Documentation for each script can be found using the `--help` flag. In addition to the scripts, there is a jupyter notebook for experimenting with the different solutions. 

## Scripts
1. `collocate_single_text.py`: solves the basic task described above. 
2. `collocate_all_texts.py`: solves the extra task of generating one csv per text in the entire corpus
3. `collocate_corpus.py`: solves the extra task of analyzing the whole corpus as one text
