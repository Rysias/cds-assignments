# Simple Network Analysis

## Software Design
TODO
- **Single responsibility**: 
- **Interface segregation**: 
- **Liskov substitution**: 
- **Open-closed**: 
- **Dependency Inversion**: 

## Usage 
TL;DR: An example of the entire setup, testing, running pipeline can be run using the bash-script `run_project.sh`. 
### Setting up
The project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html). Setup can be done as easily as `pipenv install` (after pipenv has been installed) and activating the environment is `pipenv shell`. NB: Make sure that you have python 3.9 (or later) installed on your system!

### Using the script
TODO

```console
$ python TODO
```

## Other files
Other files not previously described include:
- `experiments.ipynb`: for interactively testing the functionality and designing (not up to date)

## Testing
The scripts were developed using a TDD-methodology using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/). To execute the test suite run `python -m pytest` from the main directory.
