## Assignment Description
In this assignment, you are going to write a ```.py``` script which can be used for network analysis. As we saw last week, pretty much anything can be formalised as a network. We're not going to focus on creating the edgelists for this project; instead, the goal is to have a script that would work the same way on _any_ input data, as long as the input format is correct. 

Your script should do the following:

- If the user enters a _single filename_ as an argument on the command line:
  - Load that edgelist
  - Perform network analysis using ```networkx```
  - Save a simple visualisation
  - Save a CSV which shows the following for every node:
    - name; degree; betweenness centrality; eigenvector_centrality
- If the user enters a _directory name_ as an argument on the command line:
  - Do all of the above steps for every edgelist in the directory
  - Save a separate visualisation and CSV for each file

## Methods and Design

### Software Design
# TODO 
- **Single responsibility**:
- **Open-closed**: 
- **Liskov substitution**: 
- **Interface segregation**: 
- **Dependency Inversion**: 

## Usage 
TL;DR: An example of the entire setup and running the pipeline can be run using the bash-script `run_project.sh`. 

### Setting up
The project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html). Setup can be done as easily as `pipenv install` (after pipenv has been installed) and activating the environment is `pipenv shell`. NB: Make sure that you have python 3.9 (or later) installed on your system!
